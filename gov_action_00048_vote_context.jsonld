The individual or entity registered to vote with respect to on-chain governance actions for its own behalf or on behalf of other owners of ada.\n+ 24 Delegated Representative (DRep). The individual or entity registered to vote with respect to on-chain governance actions for its own behalf or on behalf of other Ada Holders.\n\n- 26 Net Change Limit. Means the maximum amount or percentage by which the Cardano Treasury may not be reduced by in a given period.\n+ 26 Net Change Limit.

An individual or entity that manifests intent through the signed transactions of a Stake Pool.\n+ 28 Stake Pool Operator (SPO). An individual or entity who directly controls the cold key(s) to a Cardano block producing node.\n\n30 Block(s) vs block(s)\n\n87 - Three independent voting bodies - DReps, SPOs, and the CC - participate in on-chain voting; anyone holding multiple roles must publicly disclose such overlaps before engaging in any on-chain governance actions.\n--- This is not enforcable. An anonymous DRep could also be an anonymous SPO.\n\n>>> Now leaning towards ABSTAIN.\n\n92 - DReps may vote on all types of governance actions.\n--- A bit of a non-sensical one. While they can vote on everything, hardforks are not determined by them.\n\n94 - DReps shall ensure that any compensation received in connection with their activities as a DRep is publicly disclosed in a timely manner through relevant governance communication channels.\n--- Again, not enforcable. What do you want to do, if you find out a DRep did not disclose it? Ban them by ledger rule?\n\n95 - DReps shall not offer or provide compensation to an Ada Holder or in exchange for being appointed as a DRep or for voting on their behalf.\n--- Again, not enforcable. Same as 94.\n\n101 - SPOs shall publicly disclose if they are simultaneously voting as a DRep on the same governance actions.\n--- This is not enforcable. An anonymous DRep could also be an anonymous SPO. \n\n>>> Now leaning towards NO.\n\n103 vs 99. Almost same content, can that be shortened?\n\n106 - ... The document hosted by such a URL shall be immutable in nature and incapable of being altered after submission of the proposed governance action for on-chain voting.\n--- This reduces the hosting options dramatically. As long as the hash is correct and the document wasn't altered, the action should be valid.\n\n135  - Treasury Withdrawal Recipients shall use treasury withdrawals for the purpose set out in Section 7, paragraph 1 above.\n--- Makes no sense.\n\n- 148 - ... owners of ada.\n+ 148 - ... Ada Holders.\n\n153 - ... no confidence will result.\n--- No proper English.\n\n357/359/1141 ada holders vs Ada Holders. (It's a definition and should be capitalized). Please check 'owners of ada' and 'ada holders' in the whole document and replace it with Ada Holders."
