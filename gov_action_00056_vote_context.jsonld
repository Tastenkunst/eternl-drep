How much funding does each individual request? We see that the two individual CC participants do not request any funding, and the same might apply to some individuals within the CC groups. 200,000 ADA is a large sum for one year, roughly equivalent to a full-time salary for three people, depending on the country they live in. In any case, we would like to see more details about the discussions that took place among the CC groups.\n\n(By the way, this info action is useful for starting discussions about the topic. Once the new Constitution is active, this will become a withdrawal action, which puts more pressure on the vote.)"
