We would like to see a list (prepared by CF and SNEK), which shows which CEXs are technically capable of handling/listing CNTs and where the problem is 'just' the liquidity. Overall we would like the respective token communities to provide the liquidity for their tokens themselves, most of them have that also baked into their tokenomics anyway. Non-the-less: With a proper treasury repayment plan we might vote in favor in the future. Keep up the great work SNEK team."
