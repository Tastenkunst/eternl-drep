Only easily accessible minting of stablecoins will meaningfully enhance liquidity once the ADA price rises and users shift from ADA into stablecoins.\n\n+ It remains unclear how much actual work the board members will contribute to this effort.\n\n+ A 5-of-9 multisig setup is not sufficiently secure. If the board members are expected to actively manage substantial funds, a 7-of-9 configuration would be preferable — 50 M ADA is a strong incentive target.\n\n+ Establishing such a structure could lead to centralization in decision-making over which protocols “win” or “lose” on Cardano.\n\nNevertheless, the majority felt that the potential positive impact justified giving this initiative a chance."
